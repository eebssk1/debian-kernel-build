Subject: [PATCH] ACPI: align slab for improved memory performance

Enabling SLAB_HWCACHE_ALIGN for the ACPI object caches improves
boot speed in the ACPICA core for object allocation and free'ing
especially in the AML parsing and execution phases in boot. Testing
with 100 boots shows an average boot saving in acpi_init of ~35000
usecs compared to the unaligned version. Most of the ACPI objects
being allocated and free'd are of very short life times in the
critical paths for parsing and execution, so the extra memory used
for alignment isn't too onerous.
